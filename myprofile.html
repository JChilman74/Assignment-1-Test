    <p>I was born in Adelaide Australian, my father is Australian and my mother is Dutch. I have worked in the construction industry for my whole life so far after studying construction at Tafe. I was an active life saver in my younger days and an Australian National Kayak champion at age 14. I’m happily married with two children and enjoy spending all my spare time with them.</p>

    <p><h2>Interest in IT</h2></p>
    <p>I had an interest in computing from a young age and attempted some programming on the old Commodore 64 but played more games than anything else. Over the last 7yrs I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with the external IT service providers through the mid-tier construction company that I work for. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed putting together the IT infrastructure and software solutions that support the current 120 staff to construct multi storey commercial building all over South East Queensland.  After looking at a few different IT & Applied Science degrees I choose RMIT through OUA to allow me to not only have the flexibility to study online but the course structure seemed to fit my level of knowledge and understanding of the IT fields.</p>

    <p>I find my core attributes in the results of these tests where I approach things in a systematic way and perform better in a structured environment. I pick up and learn things easier through visual aids rather than discussions and strive for details analysis of most aspects on whatever I am working on. In a team environment I believe that I will be analytical of the discussion points and will try to work through the finer details to bring a project together. This can be an advantage in group environment’s but I will also need to be mindful to not hold up progress by dwelling on minor details.</p>
