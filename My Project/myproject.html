    <p><h1>BlueSky - HR Onboarding & System Management Software</h1></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In today’s fast paced society everyone is finding that there is an abundant amount of information out there, but most people are too time poor to be able to sift through and analyse the details to effectively make a decision that moves their company in the right direction. Who to employee? What software platforms are out there that will help manage my business? All without incurring a major increase to company overheads. BlueSky software systems is a tool that is designed to do the hard-work for you and provide you with fast effective solutions to ensure that you have the correct candidate for the job as well as taking all the pain out of managing them and the everyday processes required to run your business.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>While the unemployment rate in Australia is currently only at 5.1% as reported by the ABS Labour Force statistics (Abs.gov.au, 2019) getting the right candidate can still prove to be difficult with the skill sets that you require. Each facet of your company requires different types of people and BlueSky can find that person and get them up to speed with the company’s operations and systems as well as handle the day to day operations your employee’s may require to fulfil their required roles. BlueSky can also provide complete visibility on your company’s performance and financial monitoring, allowing you to see the returns from your investments in real time from a single application.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>BlueSky had been developed to effectively manage a diverse range of areas within your business through:</p>
    <p><b>Recruitment:</b>By simply entering some key questions relating to the job detail and role description for the position that you require, BlueSky will do all the processing for you. Each applicant applying for the position will log in, create their own personal profile and respond directly to your questions. Their responses are then vetted using advanced OCR technologies by the system and matched to your nominated criteria. The applicant’s personal information will then be automatically run through background and social media checks to produce a short listing of high calibre applicants ready for interviews. All personal information obtained would be used in accordance with the governing Privacy Act and adopted Privacy Principals (Oaic.gov.au, 2019).</p>
    <p><b>Onboarding: </b>Once the successful applicant is selected, BlueSky will manage the employment agreement and onboarding process so that the new employee is implemented into all the required company systems automatically. The new employee will complete the required online forms, so all relevant information can be utilised to set up such areas as user profile accounts, payroll and system access protocols. BlueSky will also provide the new employee with a general induction process as well as introductions to their new associated teams. Imagine your new employee being able to come in on their first day, be familiar with the company’s environment, have everything set up ready to go so they can hit the ground running and all it really took was minimal involvement from you.</p>
    <p><b>System & Information Management: </b>By utilising artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning, BlueSky will be able to interact with existing company software and system platforms to allow for easy integration into current company infrastructure. From being a central repository for company policies and documented processes to everyday form management and company communication environments. Once implemented, BlueSky can effectively manage and store all your company information in a safe and secure environment. Being an online platform, BlueSky can ensure that everyone can access the company’s database in order to complete their roles as well as effectively communicate with all team members from any location.</p>
    <p><b>Security and Access Control: </b>Every company has information that is sensitive and confidential. BlueSky allows for access controls to areas of the database based on predefined authorisations using the company’s organizational and management structure (Referenceforbusiness.com, 2019). But also BlueSky has the flexibility to allow access to areas of the database through a managerial based approval processes. This can include specific file or document access and can be set with time limit restrictions. BlueSky can also be integrated into building access management systems to grant access to certain areas of the premises, depending on the level of authority provided, or even just monitor staff movements throughout the building. Visitors and deliveries can also register through BlueSky which would allow secured automatic access to required areas such as meeting rooms and drop off areas. The BlueSky app can direct the person on their mobile device to the required location as well as provide notice of their pending arrival to the associated waiting employees.</p>
    <p><b>Reporting and Performance: </b>Being a central resource, BlueSky will be able to provide real time reporting on all aspects of the business from company cashflows and forecasts through to product development and even stock availability. This allows management staff instant visibility on the actual position of the company in a central easy to use application. BlueSky can also provide performance evaluations on employees to ensure that KPI’s are being meet or if early intervention is required for additional resourcing to be allocated to meet project deadlines.</p>
    <p>With BlueSky being an online platform the use of virtual machines (VM’s) in a network of data centres would allow fast access to the companies databases from a diverse range of locations. Mobile apps and web-based platforms would be used for user interfaces to company databases as well as collaboration and communication tools. Due to the sensitivity of the information being managed by the software, extreme security protocols and data protection systems would need to be implemented as well as effective disaster recovery solutions to ensure that BlueSky remains live at all times.</p>
    <p>Majority of the abilities to be utilised by the BlueSky software already exist in applications today and it would just require managing all aspects of the project to bring them together. The main hurdle would be to implement advanced machine learning to integrate existing software systems being used by companies.  This could be overcome with experienced programming specialists. Using resources such as system programmers and web designers to create the base platforms while system analysts work through user interfaces and technical specifications for ease of use of the application. The skills of a security manager and database administrator would also be required to manage the software’s database in a secure environment and be utilised in an ethical and legal manner.</p>
    <p>BlueSky is able to efficiently and effectively manage a company’s every day running from personnel through to system processes and the flow of information throughout a business. It provides a time saving platform that is flexible, easily accessible and can also show transparency across the whole organisation. BlueSky can also be configured to allow interconnected resourcing and data sharing between companies who are using the software to form a much larger production chain while still maintaining a secure private environment. With business models now incorporating global markets BlueSky provides a platform for worldwide collaboration which can bring people together from all walks of life.</p>
